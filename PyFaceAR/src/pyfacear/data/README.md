This package contains the canonical face mesh and landmark basis used to convert screen space landmarks into metric landmarks.
These assets were extracted from the [Google Mediapipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/) repository and were extracted from the `mediapipe/modules/face_geometry/data` directory of the repository.

The modifications made to the original assets are as follows:
- The `canonical_face_model.obj` is an exact copy of the original file.
- The `landmark_basis.json` is a JSON representation of the landmark weights as defined in `geometry_pipeline_metadata_landmarks.pbtxt` from the original repository.

The original assets are licensed under the Apache License 2.0 and can be found in [LICENSE](LICENSE).
